Handling `print` instructions from a threaded function in a subprocess without causing collisions in stdout requires careful management of how threads and the subprocess interact with shared resources (like `sys.stdout`). Here are some strategies to address this issue:

---

### **1. Use a Thread-Safe Logger**
Instead of using `print`, which writes directly to `sys.stdout`, use Python’s `logging` module. The `logging` module is thread-safe and can redirect log messages to a file, stdout, or another stream without interference.

#### **Example: Using `logging` in the Subprocess**
```python
import logging
import threading

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='[%(asctime)s] [%(threadName)s] %(message)s',
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)

def threaded_function():
    for i in range(5):
        logging.info(f"Thread is running: {i}")

def main():
    thread = threading.Thread(target=threaded_function, name="WorkerThread")
    thread.start()

    for i in range(5):
        logging.info(f"Main process iteration: {i}")

    thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This ensures all output from different threads in the subprocess is serialized, avoiding collisions.

### **2. Redirect `print` to a Thread-Safe Stream**
If you must use `print`, you can redirect `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to a thread-safe wrapper.

#### **Example: Redirecting `sys.stdout`**
```python
import sys
import threading
import queue

class ThreadSafeStream:
    def __init__(self, stream):
        self.stream = stream
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def write(self, message):
        with self.lock:
            self.stream.write(message)
            self.stream.flush()

    def flush(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.stream.flush()

# Redirect stdout
sys.stdout = ThreadSafeStream(sys.stdout)

def threaded_function():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Thread message: {i}")

def main():
    thread = threading.Thread(target=threaded_function)
    thread.start()

    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Main message: {i}")

    thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This approach ensures thread safety for `print` operations within the subprocess.

---

### **3. Use a Queue for Inter-Thread Communication**
Instead of printing directly from threads, you can use a `queue.Queue` to collect messages from threads and process them in a single output thread or loop.

#### **Example: Using `queue.Queue`**
```python
import threading
import queue

output_queue = queue.Queue()

def threaded_function():
    for i in range(5):
        output_queue.put(f"Thread message: {i}")

def output_handler():
    while True:
        message = output_queue.get()
        if message == "STOP":
            break
        print(message)

def main():
    thread = threading.Thread(target=threaded_function)
    output_thread = threading.Thread(target=output_handler)

    thread.start()
    output_thread.start()

    thread.join()
    output_queue.put("STOP")  # Signal the output thread to stop
    output_thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, threads only enqueue messages, and a single output thread handles printing, avoiding collisions.

---

### **4. Redirect Output in the Subprocess to a File**
If you don’t need to handle stdout in real-time, you can redirect the subprocess’s output (including threaded prints) to a file. This avoids the need for complex inter-thread handling.

#### **Example: Redirecting Output**
In the subprocess:
```python
import sys

# Redirect stdout and stderr to a file
with open('output.log', 'w') as log_file:
    sys.stdout = log_file
    sys.stderr = log_file

    def threaded_function():
        for i in range(5):
            print(f"Thread message: {i}")

    def main():
        thread = threading.Thread(target=threaded_function)
        thread.start()

        for i in range(5):
            print(f"Main message: {i}")

        thread.join()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
```

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Prefer `logging`:** It’s the most robust and flexible solution for threaded applications.
2. **Avoid Direct Access to `sys.stdout`:** Use wrappers or dedicated threads for writing to stdout.
3. **Use `queue.Queue` for Coordination:** This decouples message generation and output handling.
4. **Centralize Output Logic:** Handle all output in a single thread to prevent conflicts.

By applying these practices, you can ensure that `print` (or equivalent) statements in a multithreaded subprocess execute safely without interfering with stdout or causing threading issues.
